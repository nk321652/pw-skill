        "Polymorphim is crucial in object oriented programming because it enables a single interface tp handle different types of objects promoting code reusability flexibility and maintainability. It allows objects of different classes to be treated of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass or interface simlyfying code and making it easier to extend and modify.\n",
